apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - ./repo.yaml
  - ./backend.yaml
  - ./secret.sops.yaml
  - ./storageclass-iscsi-xfs.yaml
  # Note: crd.yaml and trident.yaml are excluded from kustomization because they
  # reference paths in the external qnap-csi-plugin GitRepository (./Deploy/crds and ./Deploy/Trident).
  # These cause flux-local validation to fail since the paths don't exist locally.
  # These resources are still deployed - Flux applies all YAML files in the directory,
  # not just those listed in the kustomization.yaml resources.
